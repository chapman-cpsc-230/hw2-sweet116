**Author:** _\<Branden Sweetser\>_

**Due date:** _\<March 4 2016\>_

## Description

_\<* Queries the user for a floating point number, which we will call `b` (should not be equal to `1.0`),
 and a natural number, which we will call `n`.
* Compute the sum `1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^n`.
* Print the result of this computation
* Print the value `b^(n+1)/(b-1)`.

Submit this program as `sum_powers.py`
* Query the user for an initial tea temperature `T_tea`, an ambient temperature `T_air` and a number of hours minutes `num_minutes`
* Print a table of the approximate temperature of the tea at each minute $m$ from 0 up to but not including `num_minutes`.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I began to practice using python and code to solve mathematical problems with basic coding that can solve everyday problems\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
